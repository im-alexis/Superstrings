# Superstrings

This is Project 1 for ECE 312 Spring 2022. 

The idea behind this project to be able to traverse through stings.

Given an array of characters as a string[] = [hi be '\0']

Given another array of characters as a superstring = [hi hibe \nbet box'\0']

The goal is that for every word x in string, print every word y in superstring such that x can be found in y. 
(ex take the word hi from string then print hi, hibe from superstrings)

The outout from string[] and superstring[] should be:
hi

hibe

hibe

bet
